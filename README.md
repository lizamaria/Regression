# 3D House Project

- Repository: `regression`
- Type of Challenge: `consolidation`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Deadline: `18/12/2020`
- Deployment strategy :
	 Github page
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Mission objectives 
pre-process, regress, and evaluate a dataset from start to finish

## Consolidation objectives 

- to be able to regress a dataset 
- to be able to evaluate your regression model


## The Mission

> My time machine is set to the year **2100**! I want to arrive in the country with the longest expected life expectancy! 

Choose 5 countries and regress their life expectancy data. Extrapolate and predict the life expectancy for the future. 


### Must-have features

- At least one properly regressed country
- model evaluation using:
	- adjusted R^2 value ifo model complexity (e.g. DOF)
	- splitting the dataset and comparing train and test results
 - at least one prediction of a country for future life expectancy (how reliable is your extrapolation?)

### Nice-to-have features

- 5 (or more) properly regressed countries
- further model evaluation:
	- k-cross validation
	- p-value of predictors
	- f-test


## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Download the [WHO dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
4. Regress


## Evaluation criterias
1. It works (no bugs in the console, no error)
2. You use Git from the start and during the entire process of the development (at least one push per day)

## A final note of encouragement
